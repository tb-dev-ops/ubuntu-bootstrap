# Ubuntu Bootstrap
Bash script to automate the configuration and package installation for Ubuntu systems.

## Install ubuntu-bootstrap
Run the following command on the Ubuntu box you wish to setup:  
`bash <(curl -L https://raw.github.com/deadbits/ubuntu-bootstrap/master/bootstrap.sh)`
  
This script will first install Git in order to clone this repository, prompt you for your sudo password that is used through-out the rest of the installation, and then proceed with each module.
  
Some individual stages will prompt you to answer yes or no questions for which components you want installed. This process is still very easy, I promise.

## Modules
Please manually review each modules source to make sure you want to perform all of the actions.
If you do not want a specific module to run, just comment out the `source core/<module>.sh` line inside `bootstrap.sh`.
